=head1 NAME

digest_nc.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Check and collect metadata in netCDF files.
The metadata are checked against a configuration file that define
which metadata are expected.

=head1 USAGE

  digest_nc.pl <config> <inputfile> <ownertag> <xmlfile>

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over

=item config

Path to etc directory containing configuration files

=item inputfile

Path to input file. The first line in this file is an URL that points to where
the data will be found by users. This dataref URL will be included as metadata in
the XML file to be produced.
The rest of the lines comprise the files to be parsed, one file
on each line. These files all belongs to one dataset.

=item ownertag

Short keyword (e.g. "DAM") that will tag the data in the database
as owned by a specific project/organisation.

=item xmlfile

Path to an XML file that will receive the result of the netCDF parsing. If this
