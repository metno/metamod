This module comprise two main systems:

   - A web application for users to upload files to the METAMOD2 data repository.
     This application is found in the htdocs/upl directory and is documented in
     the htdocs/upl/README file.

   - Pearl scripts for monitoring uploaded files and extracting metadata from
     these files. Currently, metadata can only be extracted from netCDF files.
     The scripts produce XML files ready to be imported to the METAMOD2 database
     by the METAMODBASE module.

     Three scripts are involved in this system:

     upload_monitor.pl    This script runs continously as long as the file
                          upl/CONTINUE_UPLOAD_MONITOR (in the webrun directory)
                          exists. It sleeps most of the time, but wakes up to
                          see if any new files are uploaded, either through
                          the web application, or directly (by ftp or another
                          program). It investigates the file type of the
                          uploaded files, and performs preparatory operations
                          on them as needed:

                          * Files compressed with gzip are uncompressed.
                          * Tar files are expanded.
                          * Cdl files are converted to netCDF.

                          Then files are sent to the digest_nc.pl script
                          which extracts the metadata from the files and
                          creates/updates the XML files with metadata.

     digest_nc.pl         This script is documented in the
                          scripts/README_digest_nc file.

     print_usererrors.pl  Both the upload_monitor.pl and the digest_nc.pl
                          script may find errors with the files that are
                          the responsibility of the data provider. This
                          script creates a summary of the errors found, in the
                          form of an HTML file which is intended for the user.
