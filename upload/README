The METAMOD2 Upload module
==========================

The Upload module is a framework for creating new datasets and extracting metadata for the
datasets from netCDF files provided by users. The netCDF files will reside in a data
repository accesible within the file system on the server where METAMOD2 is running.

The module operates in two different modes depending on the value of the configuration
variable "EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY":

EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY = false  METAMOD is the owner of the data repository. It will monitor
 (or any value except true)  directories where data providers can upload netCDF files, and
                             move the files from there into the data repository. While doing
                             this, METAMOD will extract metadata for the XML Metadata
                             repository, and check the files and eventually report to the
                             user any errors or missing metadata encountered. This is the
                             normal mode.

EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY = true   In this case, METAMOD has no responsibilty for moving netCDF
                             files into their final destination (i.e. the data repository).
                             Files are already in the repository when METAMOD recieves them.
                             The responsibility for METAMOD is only to extract metadata, 
                             check the files and eventually report any irregularities back
                             to the data provider.

This module comprise the following main systems:

   - A web application for data providers to create and manage datasets, and to upload files
     to the internal data repository. This application is found in the htdocs/upl directory
     and is documented in the htdocs/upl/README file.

   - A pearl script, upload_monitor.pl, for monitoring uploaded files and extracting
     metadata from these files. Currently, metadata can only be extracted from netCDF files.
     The scripts produce XML files ready to be imported to the METAMOD2 database by the
     METAMODBASE module. The script sleeps most of the time, but wakes up to see if any new
     files are uploaded, either through the web application, or directly (by ftp or another
     program). It investigates the file type of the uploaded files, and performs preparatory
     operations on them as needed:

        * Files compressed with gzip are uncompressed.
        * Tar files are expanded.
        * Cdl files are converted to netCDF.

     Then files are sent to the digest_nc.pl script which extracts the metadata from the
     files and creates/updates the XML files with metadata.

   - A web service used for registering netCDF files already in the data repository. This
     service is intended for systems with an external data repository. The service is
     implemented by newfiles.php and the perl script upload_indexer.pl. 

   - A perl script, digest_nc.pl, for extracting metadata from netCDF files. This script
     is documented in the scripts/README_digest_nc file.

   - A perl script, print_usererrors.pl, for generating error reports (as html files) for
     the data provider. The scripts responsible for controlling netCDF files 
     (upload_monitor.pl, upload_indexer.pl and digest_nc.pl) may find errors with the files
     that should be corrected by the data provider.
