General cleanup tasks for Metamod2
==================================

Major bugs should be registered in Bugzilla.
Feature requests should go into the METSIS project priority lists.

Remaining (non-controversional) household chores of minor importance can go
here lest they are forgotten.  These are not meant as topics for discussion,
just as an electronic Post-It note for developers to quickly note action
points for later.

--------------------

* deletion of datasets by user (done)

* better metadata conversion (new major feature)

set default time in wms selector

adduser script (for userbase)

show_gen_config script (as in admin web)

mailtest script

add packagees, update download docs in https://wiki.met.no/metamod/download

find out how to move index link in html docs to left col

how to spec boundingbox and maxextent (from getcap?)

multiple thumbnails in wmsinfo (for separate map and data layers)

add timeslider in wms (from nrk)

merge layers from several datasets in wmc

DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Pg: DBD::Pg 2.9.2 or greater is strongly recommended

upgrade List::MoreUtils to 0.30 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- Change the way we localise PERL_DL_NONLAZY to false to remove
	  a warning that some people were seeing. The new approach is taken
	  from the way that List::Util does it.

++++++++ DONE ++++++++++++++
