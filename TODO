General cleanup tasks for Metamod2
==================================

Major bugs should be registered in Bugzilla.
Feature requests should go into the METSIS project priority lists.

Remaining (non-controversional) household chores of minor importance can go
here lest they are forgotten.  These are not meant as topics for discussion,
just as an electronic Post-It note for developers to quickly note action
points for later.
