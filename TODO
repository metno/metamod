General cleanup tasks for Metamod2
==================================

Major bugs should be registered in Bugzilla.
Feature requests should go into the METSIS project priority lists.

Remaining (non-controversional) household chores of minor importance can go
here lest they are forgotten.  These are not meant as topics for discussion,
just as an electronic Post-It note for developers to quickly note action
points for later.

--------------------

* better metadata conversion (new major feature)

set default time in wms selector

adduser script (for userbase)

show_gen_config script (as in admin web)

mailtest script

add packagees, update download docs in https://wiki.met.no/metamod/download

find out how to move index link in html docs to left col

how to spec boundingbox and maxextent (from getcap?)
- must be reprojected, insolvable problem accd to trond

multiple thumbnails in wmsinfo (for separate map and data layers)

add timeslider in wms (from nrk)
- nrk not gpl
- port from trond's old geoext?

DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Pg: DBD::Pg 2.9.2 or greater is strongly recommended

upgrade List::MoreUtils to 0.30 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- Change the way we localise PERL_DL_NONLAZY to false to remove
	  a warning that some people were seeing. The new approach is taken
	  from the way that List::Util does it.

test selector for multiple baselayers
- last baselayer selected must remain with led on (guessing it should work)

++++++++ DONE ++++++++++++++

only allow projections usable with selected layers in selector

mark layerchanger title bar when visible 

show visibility in layerselector

* deletion of datasets by user (done)
	nameing problem with APPLIC_ID

merge layers from several datasets in wmc

fix scripts using Metamod::Config qw(:init_logger)

add verportal datasets for testing wmsdiana

remove remaining php stuff

fixed linebreaks in example wms/proj xml

sort out how to deal with different times for each layer

fix sorting so works for both wmsdiana and ncwms

add baselayer/transparency options to wmssetup

style selector must differentiate between layers

diana(?) bug crops west edge for hirlam

wms/proj help texts
