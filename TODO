General cleanup tasks for Metamod2
==================================

Major bugs should be registered in Bugzilla.
Feature requests should go into the METSIS project priority lists.

Remaining (non-controversional) household chores of minor importance can go
here lest they are forgotten.  These are not meant as topics for discussion,
just as an electronic Post-It note for developers to quickly note action
points for later.

--------------------

* deletion of datasets by user
* better metadata conversion

remove remaining php stuff:

common/htdocs/funcs/mmConfig.inc

common/lib/Metamod/LoggerConfigParser.pm
166:    my $log4php_config_file = $mm_config->get('LOG4PHP_CONFIG');
184:        warn "LOG4PHP_CONFIG missing from master config. log4php config not created\n";

common/scripts/update_logger_config.pl
79:    my $php_config_path = $mm_config->get("LOG4PHP_CONFIG");
