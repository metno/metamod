General cleanup tasks for Metamod2

Major bugs should be registered in Bugzilla.
Feature requests should go into the METSIS project priority lists.

Remaining (non-controversional) household chores of minor importance can go
here lest they are forgotten.  These are not meant as topics for discussion,
just as an electronic Post-It note for developers to quickly note action
points for later.

--------------------

remove unused config directives:
    all of METAMODQUEST configuration except QUEST_CONFIGURATIONS, QUEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
	QUEST_METADATA_UPLOAD_FORM
	QUEST_SENDER_ADDRESS
	QUEST_RECIPIENTS
	QUEST_OKMESSAGE
	QUEST_FORM_DEFINITON_FILE
	QUEST_ADM_BACKGROUND
	QUEST_ADM_TOPDIR
	QUEST_FORM_DEFINITON_FILE
	QUEST_CONFIG_DIRECTORY

use setgid on webrun catalog for correct ownership of new files

use mode 644 for files written to webrun

fix bloody "You must call new() once before you can call instance()" bug that's been around forever

copy bounding box for each layer from cap to wmc (nve)
- what if > 1 projection?

add search option for wmsinfo and projectioninfo
* using lsds works for now

fix fakeroot in debian make

rework log appenders so services use metamod.log and terminal use stderr

set default ownertag to all in search

add docs for custom oai validators

add animation of current wms layer

clean up multiwmc controller, moving processing to utils

clean up ds_filepath in database to exclude extension whenever found

remove download from basket unless has data_file_location

default catalyst port to master_config, not 3000 (maybe not)

postgres preparation (postgis, pgcrypto, tsearch2) should be separate from
database/table generation, and should be run on the server where the postgis
sql files are installed (so you get the correct version and won't have to install
postgis/pg-server on the webserver)

make services status run without sudo

check if user exists before saying password change has been effected

separate thumbnail elements in wmsinfo for level 1 and 2

proper handling of timeout from wms server

* better metadata conversion (new major feature)

adduser script (for userbase)

mailtest script

add packagees, update download docs in https://wiki.met.no/metamod/download

find out how to move index link in html docs to left col (js)
[MaG
DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Pg: DBD::Pg 2.9.2 or greater is strongly recommended

upgrade List::MoreUtils to 0.30 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- Change the way we localise PERL_DL_NONLAZY to false to remove
	  a warning that some people were seeing. The new approach is taken
	  from the way that List::Util does it.

wms thumbnails:
- multiple thumbnails in wmsinfo (for separate map and data layers)
- swap z-order so map is baselayer and data transparent (maybe not? why?)
- read wmsthumbs in wmslist from capab
- cache wmsthums from capab in database when changing wmsinfo

reset password should send a link to reset instead of resetting directly to avoid misuse
- also check that username exists before confirming
- must use POST

++++++++ DONE ++++++++++++++

fix "get basket url"

fixed fatal error in basket visualization on wms server error

fixed bug in basket size
