General cleanup tasks for Metamod2

Major bugs should be registered in Bugzilla.
Feature requests should go into the METSIS project priority lists.

Remaining (non-controversional) household chores of minor importance can go
here lest they are forgotten.  These are not meant as topics for discussion,
just as an electronic Post-It note for developers to quickly note action
points for later.

--------------------

Catalyst::Log::Log4perl is DEPRECATED, update your app to use Log::Log4perl::Catalyst FIXME 2.13

catalyst/lib/MetamodWeb.pm#92: Deprecated 'static' config key used, please use the key 'Plugin::Static::Simple' instead

put projstrings in separate list instead of hardcoded in Metno::Fimex

get projection list from master_config in Metamod::WMS

make services status run without sudo

check if user exists before saying password change has been effected

separate thumbnail elements in wmsinfo for level 1 and 2

proper handling of timeout from wms server

* better metadata conversion (new major feature)

adduser script (for userbase)

show_gen_config script (as in admin web)

mailtest script

add packagees, update download docs in https://wiki.met.no/metamod/download

find out how to move index link in html docs to left col

DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Pg: DBD::Pg 2.9.2 or greater is strongly recommended

upgrade List::MoreUtils to 0.30 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- Change the way we localise PERL_DL_NONLAZY to false to remove
	  a warning that some people were seeing. The new approach is taken
	  from the way that List::Util does it.

impossible to access metamod::config->instance in metamod::wms and wmc.pm so
links to wms.met.no must be hardcoded

wms thumbnails:
- multiple thumbnails in wmsinfo (for separate map and data layers)
- swap z-order so map is baselayer and data transparent (maybe not? why?)
- read wmsthumbs in wmslist from capab
- cache wmsthums from capab in database when changing wmsinfo

reset password should send a link to reset instead of resetting directly to
avoid misuse
- also check that username exists before confirming
- must use POST

++++++++ DONE ++++++++++++++

set default time in wms selector

fix timeslider to show on startup layer (again)

get visualize basket to work again

add timeslider in wms
- use openlayers-timeslider from HALO

refresh proj list in wmslist on history.back()

how to spec boundingbox and maxextent (from getcap?)
- must be reprojected, insolvable problem accd to trond

test selector for multiple baselayers
- last baselayer selected must remain with led on (guessing it should work)

only allow projections usable with selected layers in selector

mark layerchanger title bar when visible

show visibility in layerselector

* deletion of datasets by user (done)
	nameing problem with APPLIC_ID

merge layers from several datasets in wmc

fix scripts using Metamod::Config qw(:init_logger)

add verportal datasets for testing wmsdiana

remove remaining php stuff

fixed linebreaks in example wms/proj xml

sort out how to deal with different times for each layer

fix sorting so works for both wmsdiana and ncwms

add baselayer/transparency options to wmssetup

style selector must differentiate between layers

diana(?) bug crops west edge for hirlam

wms/proj help texts
