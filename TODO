Quest in upload/admin
===================== 
* password for quest, or generally better session handling (PHP build in sessions?)
* automatically filling data from directory contents

General tasks for Metamod2
==========================
* central security handling
* unified session handling
* splitting config: installation config, runtime config, app runtime config
   reading runtime config on the fly,
   reducing number of [==VAR==] in scripts to close to 0
* using single metadata-configuration for quest and upload
  * using another config (but connected) for digest_nc.pl to extract metadata
    from nc-files
* cleanup datacollection_period and datacollection_period_from/_to
* concentrate on one scripting language, avoid the other
* use centralised logging, i.e. log4php or simply mmLogging.php

Update of Datasets (assigned to Heiko)
=====================================
* generate module to read a dataset2 from the database
* qst to read from database/write to disk
* digest_nc.pl to write dataset2
* import_dataset.pl to read dataset2; import_dataset.pl to have converters from other datasets


TODO (assigned to Heiko, just for synchronization)
==================================================
* test digest_nc.pl
