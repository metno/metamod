UPDATING FROM 2.2 to 2.3 (current trunk)
========================================

The current trunk add full-text search capabilities to Metamod. This
requires some additional steps to update from an older version:

a) Install the postgres ts2search extension (postgresql-contrib package)
   This step is only required for postgres < 8.3

b) Add the location of the full path of tsearch2.sql to master_config.txt

c) To use the fulltext-search, add the keyword 'FullText' to the
   SEARCH_CATEGORY_SEQUENCE in master_config.txt, i.e.
   SEARCH_CATEGORY_SEQUENCE = 4,1,7,2,9,8,FullText
   

d) If you want to keep the existing database, that is, you don't want to
   reinstall all datasets, you need to do the following:
   i) install the tsearch2.sql script
   ii) install the update2.2To2.3.sql script
   iii) create the full-text index for the existing data with
        makeDatabaseFulltextAware_2.2-2.3.pl
