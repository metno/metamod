UPDATING FROM 2.2 to 2.3 (current trunk)
========================================

The current trunk add full-text search capabilities to Metamod. This
requires some additional steps to update from an older version:

a) Install the postgres ts2search extension (postgresql-contrib package)
   This step is only required for postgres < 8.3

b) Add the location of the full path of tsearch2.sql to master_config.txt as
   PG_TSEARCH2_SCRIPT = /usr/share/postgresql/8.1/contrib/tsearch2.sql

c) Add the used language for the full-text index (e.g. default for pg <= 8.2 and english for pg >= 8.3)
   PG_TSEARCH_LANGUAGE = 'english' 


d) To use the fulltext-search, add the keyword 'FullText' to the
   SEARCH_CATEGORY_SEQUENCE in master_config.txt, i.e.
   SEARCH_CATEGORY_SEQUENCE = 4,1,7,2,9,8,FullText
   

e) If you want to keep the existing database, that is, you don't want to
   reinstall all datasets, you need to do the following:

   i) Run the tsearch2.sql script (using psql)
   ii) Run the update2.2To2.3.sql script (using psql)
   iii) create the full-text index for the existing data with
        makeDatabaseFulltextAware_2.2-2.3.pl
        
   These steps are achieved by running the script:

   init/update_to_Fulltext.sh

f) consider setting 'random_page_cost = 2' (or lower) in postgresql.conf
   for better search performance
