fmquest
=======

Øystein Godøy, METNO/FOU, 21.09.2007 

Easy and relatively flexible questionnaire generation.

The user edits:
	o fmquest.php (the main page, add layout and config information)
	o myconfig.txt (or some other file)

fmquest.php
===========
The main page that generates and processes HTML forms. The user can modify
the name of the configuration file containing the form elements to be
produced as well as general layout elements (e.g. adding the logo of the
project in mind, chenging the style sheet included in the HEAD element etc).

myconfig.txt
============
Text file that describes the elements to be added to the form. Elements
are of the type:
	type=text&label=Telefax&length=25&size=25&name=fax

type: type of element, e.g. radio, text, textarea, list, checkbox, button etc
label: label to prepend the form element
name: name of the variable to be generated
length: length of the element (only for text and textarea)
height: height of the element (only for text and textarea)
size: size of the element (only for text)

Elements that can contain several elements (e.g. radio, checkbox, list)
separate these by '|'.

If test functionality of input fields are wanted, some specific variable names
should be used (e.g. for geographical positions (nothernmost_latitude,
southermost_latitude, easternmost_longitude, westernmost_longitude) and dates
(datacollection_period_from, datacollection_period_to)

Other issues
