quest
=====

Easy and relatively flexible questionnaire generation.

General config should be done through the master_config.txt file
of the application. The user should add the formular template
(e.g. myconfig.txt) into the htdocs/qst/config directory of the application.

myconfig.txt
============
Text file that describes the elements to be added to the form. Elements
are of the type:
	type=text&label=Telefax&length=25&size=25&name=fax

type: type of element, e.g. radio, text, textarea, list, checkbox, button etc
label: label to prepend the form element
name: name of the variable to be generated
length: length of the element (only for text and textarea)
height: height of the element (only for text and textarea)
size: size of the element (only for text)

Elements that can contain several elements (e.g. radio, checkbox, list)
separate these by '|'.

If test functionality of input fields are wanted, some specific variable names
should be used (e.g. for geographical positions (nothernmost_latitude,
southermost_latitude, easternmost_longitude, westernmost_longitude) and dates
(datacollection_period_from, datacollection_period_to)
