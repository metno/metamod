Things to do in Catalyst version of Metamod
-------------------------------------------


* move openlayers and get rid of local symlinks [GA]
    ~/projects/metamod28/src/catalyst$ ls -l `find . -type l`
    ./master_config_dev.txt -> /home/user/projects/metamod28/catnip/master_config.txt

* check that wmsinfo data gets imported from test xmlfiles [GA]

* Implement support for reprojections (Lat/long and Stereo). This can be implemented as a port of the current PHP code.
  At a later time this should be supported using some type of WPS service, but not for this version. [HK]

* Fix result tables that overflow the current layout. This might require a complete re-thinking of the visual design.

* Setup nighly integration (test_application) and test machines.

* change subscription feature to link to existing php pages [ØT]

* Add option for removing columns from the result page. See current implementation.

* Fix redirect when logging out after adding subscription. Should probably be done after deployment specifics are
  finished.

* Move this branch to trunk
  * Move this page afterwards to ../TODO-2.7, so we have TODO and TODO-2.7
    side by side

* Fix licenses

    DONE
------------------------------------------

* Setup and test Apache front-end proxy configuration to FastCGI Catalyst process. [GA]

* Add input validation to Data collection period dates.
  * Added calendar widget instead [GA]
  * waiting for spec for other formats

* move openlayers and get rid of local symlinks
    ./root/static/img -> ../../../search/htdocs/img/
    ./root/static/lib -> ../../../search/htdocs/lib
    ./root/xsl/gc2wmc.xsl -> ../../../search/cgi-bin/gc2wmc.xsl
    ./root/static/css/openlayers_theme -> ../../../../search/htdocs/theme

* Generate Catalyst configuration based on master_config.txt. The generation should be usable standalone (during)
  development and be included in the update_target.pl script.

* fix fancybox conflict with jquery in search

* Remove RSS feed link from level 1 datasets that do not have any level 2 datasets.

* fix buttons in result list

* fix search for datacollection period (get 'invalid input syntax for integer: "2008-07-15" ')

* reduce number of links in paging

* fix log4perl initialization
    currently seems random if done in metamod-init or catalyst

* When clicking on the map for selection map search region the map shall be displayed again instead of Topics and
  Variables.

* Add a system for adding help messages to the various parts of the search interface. The help messages should be
  configurable by an implementor. (solution was simplified as help messages are not configurable be implementor)

* Add support for setting the HTML header and footer. See header.tt and footer.tt:
  needs to integrate with existing php-based system (solution: header and footer now fetched from master_config.txt)

* Add a page that contains a link to all available RSS feeds. This page should not be easily accessible to a human user
  but instead accessible to search engines for indexing. Solution: The link is now not to RSS feeds as those are not
  indexed by Google, but instead to plain HTML pages.

* Test integration with part of the application that will still be in PHP. Solution: Subscription link is now tested.
