Things to do in Catalyst version of Metamod
-------------------------------------------

* modify xml validator to use xml catalogs

* add dialog to confirm overwriting previously uploaded files

* security filters for appid/ownertag?

* config for godiva instead of openlayers?

* use config::general?

* fix bug where init.d doesn't restart/stop catalyst (when?)

* make gen_httpd_conf run during update_target

* check if user registration works on dev-vm140

* check that wmsinfo data gets imported from test xmlfiles [GA]
  * not really a catalyst issue

    DONE
------------------------------------------

* mm-xml file editor [GA]

* File Upload [GA]
  * test a file
  * upload file
    * check key
  * upload_indexer + webservice
  * dataset admin
  * metadata editor [ØT]
    * wms setup

* Implement support for reprojections (Lat/long and Stereo). This can be implemented as a port of the current PHP code.
  At a later time this should be supported using some type of WPS service, but not for this version. [HK]

* Add section header + menu in templates [GA]

* Setup nighly integration (test_application) and test machines. [ØT]

* move WMS coastlines urls in thumbs + wms.tt to master_config [GA]

* Fix redirect when logging out after adding subscription. Should probably be done after deployment specifics are
  finished. [GA]

* investigate tests for DBIx::Class::ResultSet::RecursiveUpdate (fails if sqlite installed)
  * tests are broken in cpan - both hardy and lucid reports error, but test passes in hardy

* Move this branch to trunk
  * Move this page afterwards to ../TODO-2.7, so we have TODO and TODO-2.7
    side by side
    * why? the idea is that this list should be empty before we release version 2.7 [GA]

* init.d-script for starting/stopping catalyst [GA]

* autogenerate JSON catalyst config when starting catalyst server [GA]

* update_target must check that webrun is owned by APPLICATION_USER [GA]

* Fix result tables that overflow the current layout. This might require a complete re-thinking of the visual design.
  * Not important according to Heiko

* Setup and test Apache front-end proxy configuration to FastCGI Catalyst process. [GA]

* Add input validation to Data collection period dates.
  * Added calendar widget instead [GA]
  * waiting for spec for other formats

* move openlayers and get rid of local symlinks
    ./root/static/img -> ../../../search/htdocs/img/
    ./root/static/lib -> ../../../search/htdocs/lib
    ./root/xsl/gc2wmc.xsl -> ../../../search/cgi-bin/gc2wmc.xsl
    ./root/static/css/openlayers_theme -> ../../../../search/htdocs/theme

* Generate Catalyst configuration based on master_config.txt. The generation should be usable standalone (during)
  development and be included in the update_target.pl script.

* fix fancybox conflict with jquery in search

* Remove RSS feed link from level 1 datasets that do not have any level 2 datasets.

* fix buttons in result list

* fix search for datacollection period (get 'invalid input syntax for integer: "2008-07-15" ')

* reduce number of links in paging

* fix log4perl initialization
    currently seems random if done in metamod-init or catalyst

* When clicking on the map for selection map search region the map shall be displayed again instead of Topics and
  Variables.

* Add a system for adding help messages to the various parts of the search interface. The help messages should be
  configurable by an implementor. (solution was simplified as help messages are not configurable be implementor)

* Add support for setting the HTML header and footer. See header.tt and footer.tt:
  needs to integrate with existing php-based system (solution: header and footer now fetched from master_config.txt)

* Add a page that contains a link to all available RSS feeds. This page should not be easily accessible to a human user
  but instead accessible to search engines for indexing. Solution: The link is now not to RSS feeds as those are not
  indexed by Google, but instead to plain HTML pages.

* Test integration with part of the application that will still be in PHP. Solution: Subscription link is now tested.

* change subscription feature to link to existing php pages [ØT]

* Add option for removing columns from the result page. See current implementation.

* Fix licenses
