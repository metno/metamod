Directory for the DOKIPY project. Used as an application directory for METAMOD 2.x

NOTE: DOKIPY does not use its own database. This application must accordingly operate
together with an application that use the METAMODBASE module (i.e. damocles).

Directory content:

export_to_day.sh          Old script for copying files to dokipy@damocles

ext.master_config.txt     Master config file used on dokipy@damocles. Probably out-dated.

filelist.txt              Files in this directory (and subdirectories) that are part of
                          the DOKIPY application.

htdocs                    Directory for the main PHP scripts and METAMODQUEST
                          configuration files.

ice.master_config.txt     Master config file used on ice. Works with trunk.

install.sh                Installation script for the dokipy@damocles installation.
                          To be run on dokipy@damocles when the files have been copied
                          to dokipy@damocles.

master_config.txt         Just a sym-link to the master config file that is tested.

prepare_runtime_env.sh    A portable installation script doing some of the work of
                          install.sh (and some more). Imported from the damocles
                          application. Not yet used in dokipy.
