 The DAMOCLES data repository is divided into directories owned by individual
 users (data providers). As a data provider, you may create new directories
 (using the "Administration" page), and upload files to these directories
 (using the "Upload files" page). New files are checked against the file
 format requirements used in the DAMOCLES project. If the file does not comply
 with these requirements, you will recieve an E-mail explaining the errors
 found.
