<h1><a name="metadata_extration">Metadata extration</a></h1>
<p>METAMOD supports extracting metadata from netCDF files. The metadata extraction
is triggered in three different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A user uploads a data file or tar archive via the web interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data files are upload via a FTP to a folder that is monitored by METAMOD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data files are placed in a folder available to METAMOD and then a HTTP request
is sent to METAMOD to trigger the metadata extraction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which method is used for triggering uploads are decided by the
<code>EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY</code> configuration variables.</p>
<p>If <code>EXTERNAL_REPOSTORY</code> is set to <code>false</code> the two first methods can be used.
In this case METAMOD is also responsible for moving the data files to the data
repository in addition to extracting the metadata.</p>
<p>If <code>EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY</code> is set to <code>true</code> the second method is used. In this
case METAMOD will <strong>not</strong> move the  data files to the data repository. The data
repository is then some other system responsibility.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="upload_via_web_interface">Upload via web interface</a></h2>
<p>When a user uploads a new data file to the system using the web interface the following steps
are executed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The web application performs some validation of the file and the name of the
dataset and if all validations are ok it stores the file in the directory
specified in the configuration variable <code>UPLOAD_DIRECTORY</code>.</p>
<p>The web application also inserts an &quot;Upload&quot; job into the queue to tell the
backend system that a new file is available.</p>
<p>At this point the web application sends a reply back to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that there is a now job in the queue a <strong>worker process</strong> will start to
execute the job as soon as a worker process is available.</p>
<p>For the Upload job, <code>Metamod::Queue::Worker::Upload</code> and
<code>Metamod::Queue::Job::Upload</code> is used to perform the job. The reason for
having two modules for doing this work is that Worker module is specific the
queue system used, while the Job module is independent of the actual queue
system. This makes it easier to switch from one queue system to another at a
later date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When <code>Metamod::Queue::Job::Upload</code> has started to execute the job it will
leave the heavy lifting to <code>Metamod::UploadHelper</code>. UploadHelper will do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a directory structure where it can put temporary files while it is working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the upload file is a gz, tar.gz or tar file it will extract the contents of
archive and then continue to work on the contents of the archive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any of the uploaded files are CDL files it will try to convert the files to
netCDF files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When all the files are ready for processing it will use <code>MetNo::DigestNc</code> to
extract the metadata from the netCDF files. This processing in done twice. Once
for all the uploaded at the same time to extract the level 1 metadata for the
dataset. Then DigestNc is used again for each file to extract the level 2
metadata for that file.</p>
<p>DigestNc use <code>Metamod::Dataset</code> for reading and writing metadata so all data
is stored both in the XML metadata repository and the index database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the metadata has been extracted the data files are moved to the data
repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on how the processing of the files went the UploadHelper will notify
the user on the result of the upload via email and also write the result of the
upload to the User database.</p>
<p>In case of any error in the processing of the file the UploadHelper will
generate a HTML file with a description of all the errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="upload_via_ftp">Upload via FTP</a></h2>
<p>Upload via FTP is very similar to upload via web except for the first steps
that triggers the metadata extraction.</p>
<p>Instead of using the queue system the FTP upload is triggered by the script
upload/scripts/ftp_monitor.pl. This script supports several different modes but
the most relevant here is the daemon mode where it is running like a CRON-like
job.</p>
<p>When running as a CRON-like job the script will wake up at regular intervals
and start looking for files in the <code>FTP_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY</code>.</p>
<p>When looking for files in the ftp upload directory it will not process all
files that it finds. What files to process is specificed in the <code>ftp_events</code>
file in the <code>WEBRUN_DIRECTORY</code>.</p>
<p>When a file is found in the FTP directory the metadata extraction continous in
the same way for web uploads using the <code>Metamod::UploadHelper</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="metadata_extraction_from_external_repository">Metadata extraction from external repository</a></h2>
<p>Metadata extraction when data is stored in a external repository works
differently than the two other methods.</p>
<p>In this case the process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A process external to METAMOD places one or more data files in a directory that
is available from the METAMOD instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The external process notifies METAMOD that new files are ready for metadata
extraction by sending a HTTP GET message to /upload/newfiles with the correct parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The METAMOD web application will receive the HTTP request and then start the
script <code>upload/script/upload_index.pl</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The upload_index.pl script will then follow the same steps as UploadHelper for
extracting the metadata. The only difference is that it will <strong>not</strong> move the
data files into a data repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
