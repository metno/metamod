>HISTORY</a></h1>

<p>The Template Toolkit began its life as the <code>Text::MetaText</code> module,
originally released to CPAN around 1996.
This itself was the public manifestation of an earlier template processing system I developed while working at Peritas (now Knowledge Pool - http://www.knowledgepool.com/)</p>

<p><code>Text::MetaText</code> was the prototype - the one we always planned to throw away.
It did the job well,
showing us what worked and what didn&#39;t,
what was good and what was bad,
and gave us some ideas about what could be done better,
given the chance to start again from scratch.</p>

<p>Some time late in 1998 I threw away the prototype and started work on the Template Toolkit.
By then I was working at Canon Research Centre Europe Ltd.
(CRE),
involved in a general research programme related to web publishing and dynamic content generation.
The first alpha release was in June 1999,
followed by numerous more alpha and beta releases culminating in 1.00 being released on 2nd December 1999.</p>

<p>A month or so later,
work had begun on version 2.00.
The plan was to get the template language relatively stable in version 1.00 and not worry too much about performance or other internal matters.
Then,
version 2.00 would follow to improve performance,
clean up the architecture and fix anything that,
with the benefit of hindsight,
we thought could be improved.
As it happens,
me starting work on version 2.00 coincided with Doug Steinwand sending me his parser variant which compiled templates to Perl code,
giving a major performance boost.
As well as the speedups,
there are a whole host of significant new features in version 2.00,
and a greatly improved internal architecture.
Apart from a few minor &#34;fixups&#34; the template directives and language have remained the same as in version 1.00</p>

<p>Version 2.00 was available in beta release form in July 2000,
just in time for the 4th Perl Conference where version 1.00 was awarded &#34;Best New Perl Module&#34;.
After another extended beta release period,
version 2.00 was released on 1st December 2000.</p>

<p>Version 3 has been in development ever since.</p>
