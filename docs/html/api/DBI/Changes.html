<pre>  Note: this release includes a change to the DBI::hash() function which will
  now produce different values than before *if* your perl was built with 64-bit
  &#39;int&#39; type (i.e. &#34;perl -V:intsize&#34; says intsize=&#39;8&#39;).  It&#39;s relatively rare
  for perl to be configured that way, even on 64-bit systems.

  Changed default gofer retry_limit from 2 to 0.
  Changed tests to workaround Math::BigInt broken versions.
  Changed dbi_profile_merge() to dbi_profile_merge_nodes()
    old name still works as an alias for the new one.
  Removed old DBI internal sanity check that&#39;s no longer valid
    causing &#34;panic: DESTROY (dbih_clearcom)&#34; when tracing enabled

  Changed some handle creation code from perl to C code,
    to reduce handle creation cost by ~20%.
  Changed internal implementation of the CachedKids attribute
    so it&#39;s a normal handle attribute (and initially undef).
  Changed connect_cached and prepare_cached to avoid a FETCH method call,
    and thereby reduced cost by ~5% and ~30% respectively.
  Changed _set_fbav to not croak when given a wrongly sized array,
    it now warns and adjusts the row buffer to match.
  Changed some internals to improve performance with threaded perls.
  Changed DBD::NullP to be slightly more useful for testing.
  Changed File::Spec prerequisite to not require a minimum version.
  Changed tests to work with other DBMs thanks to ZMAN.
  Changed ex/perl_dbi_nulls_test.pl to be more descriptive.

  Added more functionality to the (undocumented) Callback mechanism.
    Callbacks can now elect to provide a value to be returned, in which case
    the method won&#39;t be called. A callback for &#34;*&#34; is applied to all methods
    that don&#39;t have their own callback.
  Added $h-&#62;{ReadOnly} attribute.

    Added header to request and response packets for sanity checking
      and to enable version skew between client and server.
    Added forced_single_resultset, max_cached_sth_per_dbh and max_cached_dbh_per_drh
      to gofer executor config.
    Driver-private methods installed with install_method are now proxied.
    No longer does a round-trip to the server for methods it knows
      have not been overridden by the remote driver.
    Most significant aspects of gofer behaviour are controlled by policy mechanism.
    Added policy-controlled caching of results for some methods, such as schema metadata.
    The connect_cached and prepare_cached methods cache on client and server.
    The bind_param_array and execute_array methods are now supported.
    Worked around a DBD::Sybase bind_param bug (which is fixed in DBD::Sybase 1.07)
    Added goferperf.pl utility (doesn&#39;t get installed).
    Many other assorted Gofer related bug fixes, enhancements and docs.
    The http and mod_perl transports have been remove to their own distribution.

  Corrected docs to say that get/set of unknown attribute generates
    a warning and is no longer fatal. Thanks to Vadim.
  Corrected fetchall_arrayref() docs example thanks to Drew Broadley.

  Added $h1-&#62;swap_inner_handle($h2) sponsored by BizRate.com</pre>

  Fixed DBI::PurePerl looks_like_number() and $DBI::rows.
  Fixed ref($h)-&#62;can(&#34;foo&#34;) to not croak.

  Changed attributes (NAME, TYPE etc) of non-executed statement
    handle to be undef instead of triggering an error.
  Changed ShowErrorStatement to apply to more $dbh methods.
  Changed DBI_TRACE env var so just does this at load time:
    DBI-&#62;trace(split &#39;=&#39;, $ENV{DBI_TRACE}, 2);
  Improved &#34;invalid number of parameters&#34; error message.

  Moved methods common to all handles into DBI::common.

  Major tracing enhancement:

  Added $h-&#62;parse_trace_flags(&#34;foo|SQL|7&#34;) to map a group of
    trace flags into the corresponding trace flag bits.
  Added automatic calling of parse_trace_flags() if
    setting the trace level to a non-numeric value:
    $h-&#62;{TraceLevel}=&#34;foo|SQL|7&#34;; $h-&#62;trace(&#34;foo|SQL|7&#34;);
    DBI-&#62;connect(&#34;dbi:Driver(TraceLevel=SQL|foo):...&#34;, ...);
    Currently no trace flags have been defined.
  Added to, and reworked, the trace documentation.
  Added dbivport.h for driver authors to use.

  Major driver additions that Jeff Zucker and I have been working on:

  Added DBI::SQL::Nano a &#39;smaller than micro&#39; SQL parser
    with an SQL::Statement compatible API. If SQL::Statement
    is installed then DBI::SQL::Nano becomes an empty subclass
    of SQL::Statement, unless the DBI_SQL_NANO env var is true.
  Added DBD::File, modified to use DBI::SQL::Nano.
  Added DBD::DBM, an SQL interface to DBM files using DBD::File.

  Documentation changes:

  Corrected typos in docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Corrected execute_for_fetch example thanks to Dean Arnold.</pre>

<pre>  Fixed execute_for_array() so tuple_status parameter is optional
    as per docs, thanks to Ed Avis.
  Fixed execute_for_array() docs to say that it returns undef if
    any of the execute() calls fail.
  Fixed take_imp_data() test on m68k reported by Christian Hammers.
  Fixed write_typeinfo_pm inconsistencies in DBI::DBD::Metadata
    thanks to Andy Hassall.
  Fixed $h-&#62;{TraceLevel} to not return DBI-&#62;trace trace level
    which it used to if DBI-&#62;trace trace level was higher.

  Changed set_err() to append to errstr, with a leading &#34;\n&#34; if it&#39;s
    not empty, so that multiple error/warning messages are recorded.
  Changed trace to limit elements dumped when an array reference is
    returned from a method to the max(40, $DBI::neat_maxlen/10)
    so that fetchall_arrayref(), for example, doesn&#39;t flood the trace.
  Changed trace level to be a four bit integer (levels 0 thru 15)
    and a set of topic flags (no topics have been assigned yet).
  Changed column_info() to check argument count.
  Extended bind_param() TYPE attribute specification to imply
    standard formating of value, eg SQL_DATE implies &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;.

  Added way for drivers to indicate &#39;success with info&#39; or &#39;warning&#39;
    by setting err to &#34;0&#34; for warning and &#34;&#34; for information.
    Both values are false and so don&#39;t trigger RaiseError etc.
    Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for the original idea.
  Added $h-&#62;{HandleSetErr} = sub { ... } to be called at the
    point that an error, warn, or info state is recorded.
    The code can alter the err, errstr, and state values
    (e.g., to promote an error to a warning, or the reverse).
  Added $h-&#62;{PrintWarn} attribute to enable printing of warnings
    recorded by the driver. Defaults to same value as $^W (perl -w).
  Added $h-&#62;{ErrCount} attribute, incremented whenever an error is
    recorded by the driver via set_err().
  Added $h-&#62;{Executed} attribute, set if do()/execute() called.
  Added \%attr parameter to foreign_key_info() method.
  Added ref count of inner handle to &#34;DESTROY ignored for outer&#34; msg.
  Added Win32 build config checks to DBI::DBD thanks to Andy Hassall.
  Added bind_col to Driver.xst so drivers can define their own.
  Added TYPE attribute to bind_col and specified the expected
    driver behaviour.

  Major update to signal handling docs thanks to Lincoln Baxter.
  Corrected dbiproxy usage doc thanks to Christian Hammers.
  Corrected type_info_all index hash docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Corrected type_info COLUMN_SIZE to chars not bytes thanks to Dean Arnold.

    the method has been declared (as methods should be when using AUTOLOAD).
    This fixes a problem when the Attribute::Handlers module is loaded.
  Fixed cwd check code to use $Config{path_sep} thanks to Steve Hay.
  Fixed unqualified croak() calls thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Fixed DBD::ExampleP TYPE and PRECISION attributes thanks to Tom Lowery.
  Fixed tracing of methods that only get traced at high trace levels.

  The level 1 trace no longer includes nested method calls so it generally
    just shows the methods the application explicitly calls.
  Added line to trace log (level&#62;=4) when err/errstr is cleared.
  Updated docs for InactiveDestroy and point out where and when the
    trace includes the process id.
  Update DBI::DBD docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Removed docs saying that the DBI-&#62;data_sources method could be
    passed a $dbh. The $dbh-&#62;data_sources method should be used instead.
  Added link to &#39;DBI recipes&#39; thanks to Giuseppe Maxia:
    http://gmax.oltrelinux.com/dbirecipes.html (note that this
    is not an endorsement that the recipies are &#39;optimal&#39;)

  Fixed dbi_time() compile using BorlandC on Windows thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Fixed profile tests to do enough work to measure on Windows.

  Added $okay = $h-&#62;can($method_name) to check if a method exists.
  Added DBD::*::*-&#62;install_method($method_name, \%attr) so driver private
    methods can be &#39;installed&#39; into the DBI dispatcher and no longer
    need to be called using $h-&#62;func(..., $method_name).

  Enhanced $dbh-&#62;clone() and documentation.
  Enhanced docs to note that dbi_time(), and thus profiling, is limited
    to only millisecond (seconds/1000) resolution on Windows.

name="Changes_in_DBI_1.33,_27th_February_2003"
>Changes in DBI 1.33, 27th February 2003</a></h2>

<pre>  NOTE: Future versions of the DBI *will not* support perl 5.6.0 or earlier.
  : Perl 5.6.1 will be the minimum supported version.

  NOTE: The &#34;old-style&#34; connect: DBI-&#62;connect($database, $user, $pass, $driver);
  : has been deprecated for several years and will now generate a warning.
  : It will be removed in a later release. Please change any old connect() calls.

  Added $dbh2 = $dbh1-&#62;clone to make a new connection to the database
    that is identical to the original one. clone() can be called even after
    the original handle has been disconnected. See the docs for more details.

  Fixed merging of profile data to not sum DBIprof_FIRST_TIME values.
  Fixed unescaping of newlines in DBI::ProfileData thanks to Sam Tregar.
  Fixed Taint bug with fetchrow_hashref with help from Bradley Baetz.
  Fixed $dbh-&#62;{Active} for DBD::Proxy, reported by Bob Showalter.
  Fixed STORE to not clear error during nested DBI call,
    thanks to Tony Bowden for the report and helpful test case.
  Fixed DBI::PurePerl error clearing behaviour.
  Fixed dbi_time() and thus DBI::Profile on Windows thanks to Smejkal Petr.
  Fixed problem that meant ShowErrorStatement could show wrong statement,
   thanks to Ron Savage for the report and test case.
  Changed Apache::DBI hook to check for $ENV{MOD_PERL} instead of
    $ENV{GATEWAY_INTERFACE} thanks to Ask Bjoern Hansen.
  No longer tries to dup trace logfp when an interpreter is being cloned.
  Database handles no longer inherit shared $h-&#62;err/errstr/state storage
    from their drivers, so each $dbh has it&#39;s own $h-&#62;err etc. values
    and is no longer affected by calls made on other dbh&#39;s.
    Now when a dbh is destroyed it&#39;s err/errstr/state values are copied
    up to the driver so checking $DBI::errstr still works as expected.

  Build / portability fixes:
    Fixed t/40profile.t to not use Time::HiRes.
    Fixed t/06attrs.t to not be locale sensitive, reported by Christian Hammers.
    Fixed sgi compiler warnings, reported by Paul Blake.
    Fixed build using make -j4, reported by Jonathan Leffler.
    Fixed build and tests under VMS thanks to Craig A. Berry.

  Documentation changes:
    Documented $high_resolution_time = dbi_time() function.
    Documented that bind_col() can take an atribute hash.
    Clarified documentation for ParamValues attribute hash keys.
    Many good DBI documentation tweaks from Jonathan Leffler,
      including a major update to the DBI::DBD driver author guide.
    Clarified that execute() should itself call finish() if it&#39;s
      called on a statement handle that&#39;s still active.
    Clarified $sth-&#62;{ParamValues}. Driver authors please note.
    Removed &#34;NEW&#34; markers on some methods and attributes and
      added text to each giving the DBI version it was added in,
      if it was added after DBI 1.21 (Feb 2002).

  Changes of note for authors of all drivers:
    Added SQL_DATA_TYPE, SQL_DATETIME_SUB, NUM_PREC_RADIX, and
      INTERVAL_PRECISION fields to docs for type_info_all. There were
      already in type_info(), but type_info_all() didn&#39;t specify the
      index values.  Please check and update your type_info_all() code.
    Added DBI::DBD::Metadata module that auto-generates your drivers
      get_info and type_info_all data and code, thanks mainly to
      Jonathan Leffler and Steffen Goeldner. If you&#39;ve not implemented
      get_info and type_info_all methods and your database has an ODBC
      driver available then this will do all the hard work for you!
    Drivers should no longer pass Err, Errstr, or State to _new_drh
      or _new_dbh functions.
    Please check that you support the slightly modified behaviour of
      $sth-&#62;{ParamValues}, e.g., always return hash with keys if possible.

  Changes of note for authors of compiled drivers:
    Added dbd_db_login6 &#38; dbd_st_finish3 prototypes thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
    All dbd_*_*() functions implemented by drivers must have a
      corresponding #define dbd_*_* &#60;driver_prefix&#62;_*_* otherwise
      the driver may not work with a future release of the DBI.

  Changes of note for authors of drivers which use Driver.xst:
    Some new method hooks have been added are are enabled by
      defining corresponding macros:
          $drh-&#62;data_sources()      - dbd_dr_data_sources
          $dbh-&#62;do()                - dbd_db_do4
    The following methods won&#39;t be compiled into the driver unless
      the corresponding macro has been #defined:
          $drh-&#62;disconnect_all()    - dbd_discon_all</pre>

name="Changes_in_DBI_1.31,_29th_November_2002"
>Changes in DBI 1.31, 29th November 2002</a></h2>

<pre>  The fetchall_arrayref method, when called with a $maxrows parameter,
    no longer gives an error if called again after all rows have been
    fetched. This simplifies application logic when fetching in batches.
    Also added batch-fetch while() loop example to the docs.
  The proxy now supports non-lazy (synchronous) prepare, positioned
    updates (for selects containing &#39;for update&#39;), PlRPC config set
    via attributes, and accurate propagation of errors, all thanks
    to Steven Hirsch (plus a minor fix from Sean McMurray and doc
    tweaks from Michael A Chase).
  The DBI_AUTOPROXY env var can now hold the full dsn of the proxy driver
    plus attributes, like &#34;dbi:Proxy(proxy_foo=&#62;1):host=...&#34;.
  Added TaintIn &#38; TaintOut attributes to give finer control over
    tainting thanks to Bradley Baetz.
  The RootClass attribute no longer ignores failure to load a module,
    but also doesn&#39;t try to load a module if the class already exists,
    with thanks to James FitzGibbon.
  HandleError attribute works for connect failures thanks to David Wheeler.
  The connect() RaiseError/PrintError message now includes the username.
  Changed &#34;last handle unknown or destroyed&#34; warning to be a trace message.
  Removed undocumented $h-&#62;event() method.
  Further enhancements to DBD::PurePerl accuracy.
  The CursorName attribute now defaults to undef and not an error.

  DBI::Profile changes:
    New DBI::ProfileDumper, DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache, and
    DBI::ProfileData modules (to manage the storage and processing
    of profile data), plus dbiprof program for analyzing profile
    data - with many thanks to Sam Tregar.
    Added $DBI::err (etc) tied variable lookup time to profile.
    Added time for DESTROY method into parent handles profile (used to be ignored).

  Documentation changes:
    Documented $dbh = $sth-&#62;{Database} attribute.
    Documented $dbh-&#62;connected(...) post-connection call when subclassing.
    Updated some minor doc issues thanks to H.Merijn Brand.
    Updated Makefile.PL example in DBI::DBD thanks to KAWAI,Takanori.
    Fixed execute_array() example thanks to Peter van Hardenberg.

  Changes for driver authors, not required but strongly recommended:
    Change DBIS to DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_xxh)   [or imp_dbh, imp_sth etc]
    Change DBILOGFP to DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh) [or imp_dbh, imp_sth etc]
    Any function from which all instances of DBIS and DBILOGFP are
    removed can also have dPERLINTERP removed (a good thing).
    All use of the DBIh_EVENT* macros should be removed.
    Major update to DBI::DBD docs thanks largely to Jonathan Leffler.
    Add these key values: &#39;Err&#39; =&#62; \my $err, &#39;Errstr&#39; =&#62; \my $errstr,
    to the hash passed to DBI::_new_dbh() in your driver source code.
    That will make each $dbh have it&#39;s own $h-&#62;err and $h-&#62;errstr
    values separate from other $dbh belonging to the same driver.
    If you have a ::db or ::st DESTROY methods that do nothing
    you can now remove them - which speeds up handle destruction.</pre>

name="Changes_in_DBI_1.30,_18th_July_2002"
>Changes in DBI 1.30, 18th July 2002</a></h2>

<pre>  Fixed problems with selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, and
    selectall_arrayref introduced in DBI 1.29.
  Fixed FETCHing a handle attribute to not clear $DBI::err etc (broken in 1.29).
  Fixed core dump at trace level 9 or above.
  Fixed compilation with perl 5.6.1 + ithreads (i.e. Windows).
  Changed definition of behaviour of selectrow_array when called in a scalar
    context to match fetchrow_array.
  Corrected selectrow_arrayref docs which showed selectrow_array thanks to Paul DuBois.</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Changes_in_DBI_1.29,_15th_July_2002"
>Changes in DBI 1.29, 15th July 2002</a></h2>

<pre>  NOTE: This release changes the specified behaviour for the
  : fetchrow_array method when called in a scalar context:
  : The DBI spec used to say that it would return the FIRST field.
  : Which field it returns (i.e., the first or the last) is now undefined.
  : This does not affect statements that only select one column, which is
  : usually the case when fetchrow_array is called in a scalar context.
  : FYI, this change was triggered by discovering that the fetchrow_array
  : implementation in Driver.xst (used by most compiled drivers)
  : didn&#39;t match the DBI specification. Rather than change the code
  : to match, and risk breaking existing applications, I&#39;ve changed the
  : specification (that part was always of dubious value anyway).

  NOTE: Future versions of the DBI may not support for perl 5.5 much longer.
  : If you are still using perl 5.005_03 you should be making plans to
  : upgrade to at least perl 5.6.1, or 5.8.0. Perl 5.8.0 is due to be
  : released in the next week or so.  (Although it&#39;s a &#34;point 0&#34; release,
  : it is the most throughly tested release ever.)

  Added XS/C implementations of selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, and
    selectall_arrayref to Driver.xst. See DBI 1.26 Changes for more info.
  Removed support for the old (fatally flawed) &#34;5005&#34; threading model.
  Added support for new perl 5.8 iThreads thanks to Gerald Richter.
    (Threading support and safety should still be regarded as beta
    quality until further notice. But it&#39;s much better than it was.)
  Updated the &#34;Threads and Thread Safety&#34; section of the docs.
  The trace output can be sent to STDOUT instead of STDERR by using
    &#34;STDOUT&#34; as the name of the file, i.e., $h-&#62;trace(..., &#34;STDOUT&#34;)
  Added pointer to perlreftut, perldsc, perllol, and perlboot manuals
    into the intro section of the docs, suggested by Brian McCain.
  Fixed DBI::Const::GetInfo::* pod docs thanks to Zack Weinberg.
  Some changes to how $dbh method calls are treated by DBI::Profile:
    Meta-data methods now clear $dbh-&#62;{Statement} on entry.
    Some $dbh methods are now profiled as if $dbh-&#62;{Statement} was empty
    (because thet&#39;re unlikely to actually relate to its contents).
  Updated dbiport.h to ppport.h from perl 5.8.0.
  Tested with perl 5.5.3 (vanilla, Solaris), 5.6.1 (vanilla, Solaris), and
    perl 5.8.0 (RC3@17527 with iThreads &#38; Multiplicity on Solaris and FreeBSD).</pre>

name="Changes_in_DBI_1.28,_14th_June_2002"
>Changes in DBI 1.28, 14th June 2002</a></h2>

<pre>  Added $sth-&#62;{ParamValues} to return a hash of the most recent
    values bound to placeholders via bind_param() or execute().
    Individual drivers need to be updated to support it.
  Enhanced ShowErrorStatement to include ParamValues if available:
    &#34;DBD::foo::st execute failed: errstr [for statement ``...&#39;&#39; with params: 1=&#39;foo&#39;]&#34;

name="Changes_in_DBI_1.26,_13th_June_2002"

<pre>  Fixed t/40profile.t to work on Windows thanks to Smejkal Petr.
  Fixed $h-&#62;{Profile} to return undef, not error, if not set.
  Fixed DBI-&#62;available_drivers in scalar context thanks to Michael Schwern.

  Added C implementations of selectrow_arrayref() and fetchall_arrayref()
    in Driver.xst.  All compiled drivers using Driver.xst will now be
    faster making those calls. Most noticable with fetchall_arrayref for
    many rows or selectrow_arrayref with a fast query. For example, using
    DBD::mysql a selectrow_arrayref for a single row using a primary key
    is ~20% faster, and fetchall_arrayref for 20000 rows is twice as fast!
    Drivers just need to be recompiled and reinstalled to enable it.
    The fetchall_arrayref speed up only applies if $slice parameter is not used.
  Added $max_rows parameter to fetchall_arrayref() to optionally limit
    the number of rows returned. Can now fetch batches of rows.
  Added MaxRows attribute to selectall_arrayref()
    which then passes it to fetchall_arrayref().
  Changed selectrow_array to make use of selectrow_arrayref.
  Trace level 1 now shows first two parameters of all methods
    (used to only for that for some, like prepare,execute,do etc)
  Trace indicator for recursive calls (first char on trace lines)
    now starts at 1 not 2.

  Documented that $h-&#62;func() does not trigger RaiseError etc
    so applications must explicitly check for errors.
  DBI::Profile with DBI_PROFILE now shows percentage time inside DBI.
  HandleError docs updated to show that handler can edit error message.
  HandleError subroutine interface is now regarded as stable.</pre>

name="Changes_in_DBI_1.25,_5th_June_2002"

<pre>  Fixed build problem on Windows and some compiler warnings.
  Fixed $dbh-&#62;{Driver} and $sth-&#62;{Statement} for driver internals
    These are &#39;inner&#39; handles as per behaviour prior to DBI 1.16.
  Further minor improvements to DBI::PurePerl accuracy.</pre>

<pre>  Fixed reference loop causing a handle/memory leak
    that was introduced in DBI 1.16.
  Fixed DBI::Format to work with &#39;filehandles&#39; from IO::Scalar
    and similar modules thanks to report by Jeff Boes.
  Fixed $h-&#62;func for DBI::PurePerl thanks to Jeff Zucker.
  Fixed $dbh-&#62;{Name} for DBI::PurePerl thanks to Dean Arnold.

  Added DBI method call profiling and benchmarking.
    This is a major new addition to the DBI.
    See $h-&#62;{Profile} attribute and DBI::Profile module.
    For a quick trial, set the DBI_PROFILE environment variable and
    run your favourite DBI script. Try it with DBI_PROFILE set to 1,
    then try 2, 4, 8, 10, and -10. Have fun!

  Added execute_array() and bind_param_array() documentation
    with thanks to Dean Arnold.
  Added notes about the DBI having not yet been tested with iThreads
    (testing and patches for SvLOCK etc welcome).
  Removed undocumented Handlers attribute (replaced by HandleError).
  Tested with 5.5.3 and 5.8.0 RC1.</pre>

    to Dean Arnold. Not yet documented. See t/15array.t for examples.
    All drivers now automatically support these methods.
  Added DBI::PurePerl, a transparent DBI emulation for pure-perl drivers

<pre>  The minimum supported perl version is now 5.005_03.

  Fixed DBD::Proxy support for AutoCommit thanks to Jochen Wiedmann.
  Fixed DBI::ProxyServer bind_param(_inout) handing thanks to Oleg Mechtcheriakov.
  Fixed DBI::ProxyServer fetch loop thanks to nobull@mail.com.
  Fixed install_driver do-the-right-thing with $@ on error. It, and connect(),
    will leave $@ empty on success and holding the error message on error.
    Thanks to Jay Lawrence, Gavin Sherlock and others for the bug report.
  Fixed fetchrow_hashref to assign columns to the hash left-to-right
    so later fields with the same name overwrite earlier ones
    as per DBI &#60; 1.15, thanks to Kay Roepke.

  Changed tables() to use quote_indentifier() if the driver returns a
    true value for $dbh-&#62;get_info(29) # SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR
  Changed ping() so it no longer triggers RaiseError/PrintError.
  Changed connect() to not call $class-&#62;install_driver unless needed.
  Changed DESTROY to catch fatal exceptions and append to $@.

  Added ISO SQL/CLI &#38; ODBCv3 data type definitions thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Removed the definition of SQL_BIGINT data type constant as the value is
    inconsistent between standards (ODBC=-5, SQL/CLI=25).
  Added $dbh-&#62;column_info(...) thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added $dbh-&#62;foreign_key_info(...) thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added $dbh-&#62;quote_identifier(...) insipred by Simon Oliver.
  Added $dbh-&#62;set_err(...) for DBD authors and DBI subclasses
    (actually been there for a while, now expanded and documented).
  Added $h-&#62;{HandleError} = sub { ... } addition and/or alternative
    to RaiseError/PrintError. See the docs for more info.
  Added $h-&#62;{TraceLevel} = N attribute to set/get trace level of handle
    thus can set trace level via an (eg externally specified) DSN
    using the embedded attribute syntax:
      $dsn = &#39;dbi:DB2(PrintError=1,TraceLevel=2):dbname&#39;;
    Plus, you can also now do: local($h-&#62;{TraceLevel}) = N;
    (but that leaks a little memory in some versions of perl).
  Added some call tree information to trace output if trace level &#62;= 3
    With thanks to Graham Barr for the stack walking code.
  Added experimental undocumented $dbh-&#62;preparse(), see t/preparse.t
    With thanks to Scott T. Hildreth for much of the work.
  Added Fowler/Noll/Vo hash type as an option to DBI::hash().

  Documentation changes:

  Added DBI::Changes so now you can &#34;perldoc DBI::Changes&#34;, yeah!
  Added selectrow_arrayref &#38; selectrow_hashref docs thanks to Doug Wilson.
  Added &#39;Standards Reference Information&#39; section to docs to gather
    together all references to relevant on-line standards.
  Added link to poop.sourceforge.net into the docs thanks to Dave Rolsky.
  Added link to hyperlinked BNF for SQL92 thanks to Jeff Zucker.
  Added &#39;Subclassing the DBI&#39; docs thanks to Stephen Clouse, and
    then changed some of them to reflect the new approach to subclassing.
  Added stronger wording to description of $h-&#62;{private_*} attributes.
  Added docs for DBI::hash.

  Driver API changes:

  Now a COPY of the DBI-&#62;connect() attributes is passed to the driver
    connect() method, so it can process and delete any elements it wants.
    Deleting elements reduces/avoids the explicit
      $dbh-&#62;{$_} = $attr-&#62;{$_} foreach keys %$attr;
    that DBI-&#62;connect does after the driver connect() method returns.</pre>

name="Changes_in_DBI_1.20,_24th_August_2001"
>Changes in DBI 1.20, 24th August 2001</a></h2>

<pre>  WARNING: This release contains two changes that may affect your code.
  : Any code using selectall_hashref(), which was added in March 2001, WILL
  : need to be changed. Any code using fetchall_arrayref() with a non-empty
  : hash slice parameter may, in a few rare cases, need to be changed.
  : See the change list below for more information about the changes.
  : See the DBI documentation for a description of current behaviour.

  Fixed memory leak thanks to Toni Andjelkovic.
  Changed fetchall_arrayref({ foo=&#62;1, ...}) specification again (sorry):
    The key names of the returned hashes is identical to the letter case of
    the names in the parameter hash, regardless of the L&#60;/FetchHashKeyName&#62;
    attribute. The letter case is ignored for matching.
  Changed fetchall_arrayref([...]) array slice syntax specification to
    clarify that the numbers in the array slice are perl index numbers
    (which start at 0) and not column numbers (which start at 1).
  Added { Columns=&#62;... } and { Slice =&#62;... } attributes to selectall_arrayref()
    which is passed to fetchall_arrayref() so it can fetch hashes now.
  Added a { Columns =&#62; [...] } attribute to selectcol_arrayref() so that
    the list it returns can be built from more than one column per row.
    Why? Consider my %hash = @{$dbh-&#62;selectcol_arrayref($sql,{ Columns=&#62;[1,2]})}
    to return id-value pairs which can be used directly to build a hash.
  Added $hash_ref = $sth-&#62;fetchall_hashref( $key_field )
    which returns a ref to a hash with, typically, one element per row.
    $key_field is the name of the field to get the key for each row from.
    The value of the hash for each row is a hash returned by fetchrow_hashref.
  Changed selectall_hashref to return a hash ref (from fetchall_hashref)
    and not an array of hashes as it has since DBI 1.15 (end March 2001).
    WARNING: THIS CHANGE WILL BREAK ANY CODE USING selectall_hashref()!
    Sorry, but I think this is an important regularization of the API.
    To get previous selectall_hashref() behaviour (an array of hash refs)
    change $ary_ref = $dbh-&#62;selectall_hashref( $statement, undef, @bind);
        to $ary_ref = $dbh-&#62;selectall_arrayref($statement, { Columns=&#62;{} }, @bind);
  Added NAME_lc_hash, NAME_uc_hash, NAME_hash statement handle attributes.
    which return a ref to a hash of field_name =&#62; field_index (0..n-1) pairs.
  Fixed select_hash() example thanks to Doug Wilson.
  Removed (unbundled) DBD::ADO and DBD::Multiplex from the DBI distribution.
    The latest versions of those modules are available from CPAN sites.
  Added $dbh-&#62;begin_work. This method causes AutoCommit to be turned
    off just until the next commit() or rollback().
    Driver authors: if the DBIcf_BegunWork flag is set when your commit or
    rollback method is called then please turn AutoCommit on and clear the
    DBIcf_BegunWork flag. If you don&#39;t then the DBI will but it&#39;ll be much
    less efficient and won&#39;t handle error conditions very cleanly.
  Retested on perl 5.4.4, but the DBI won&#39;t support 5.4.x much longer.
  Added text to SUPPORT section of the docs:
    For direct DBI and DBD::Oracle support, enhancement, and related work
    I am available for consultancy on standard commercial terms.
  Added text to ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS section of the docs:
    Much of the DBI and DBD::Oracle was developed while I was Technical
    Director (CTO) of the Paul Ingram Group (www.ig.co.uk).  So I&#39;d
    especially like to thank Paul for his generosity and vision in
    supporting this work for many years.</pre>

<pre>  Made fetchall_arrayref({ foo=&#62;1, ...}) be more strict to the specification
    in relation to wanting hash slice keys to be lowercase names.
    WARNING: If you&#39;ve used fetchall_arrayref({...}) with a hash slice
    that contains keys with uppercase letters then your code will break.
    (As far as I recall the spec has always said don&#39;t do that.)
  Fixed $sth-&#62;execute() to update $dbh-&#62;{Statement} to $sth-&#62;{Statement}.
  Added row number to trace output for fetch method calls.
  Trace level 1 no longer shows fetches with row&#62;1 (to reduce output volume).
  Added $h-&#62;{FetchHashKeyName} = &#39;NAME_lc&#39; or &#39;NAME_uc&#39; to alter
    behaviour of fetchrow_hashref() method. See docs.
  Added type_info quote caching to quote() method thanks to Dean Kopesky.
    Makes using quote() with second data type param much much faster.
  Added type_into_all() caching to type_info(), spotted by Dean Kopesky.
  Added new API definition for table_info() and tables(),
    driver authors please note!
  Added primary_key_info() to DBI API thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added primary_key() to DBI API as simpler interface to primary_key_info().
  Indent and other fixes for DBI::DBD doc thanks to H.Merijn Brand.
  Added prepare_cached() insert_hash() example thanks to Doug Wilson.
  Removed false docs for fetchall_hashref(), use fetchall_arrayref({}).</pre>

  Drivers must handle AutoCommit FETCH and STORE else DBI croaks.
  Added $h-&#62;{LongReadLen} and $h-&#62;{LongTruncOk} attributes for BLOBS.
  Added DBI_USER and DBI_PASS env vars. See connect docs for usage.
  Added DBI-&#62;trace() to set global trace level (like per-handle $h-&#62;trace).
  PERL_DBI_DEBUG env var renamed DBI_DEBUG (old name still works for now).
  Updated docs, including commit, rollback, AutoCommit and Transactions sections.
  Added bind_param method and execute(@bind_values) to docs.
  Fixed fetchall_arrayref.

  Since the DBIS structure has change the internal version numbers have also
  changed (DBIXS_VERSION == 9 and DBISTATE_VERSION == 9) so drivers will have
  to be recompiled. The test is also now more sensitive and the version
  mismatch error message now more clear about what to do. Old drivers are
  likely to core dump (this time) until recompiled for this DBI. In future
  DBI/DBD version mismatch will always produce a clear error message.

  Note that this DBI release contains and documents many new features
  that won&#39;t appear in drivers for some time. Driver writers might like
  to read perldoc DBI::DBD and comment on or apply the information given.</pre>

<pre>  Added driver specification syntax to DBI-&#62;connect data_source
  parameter: DBI-&#62;connect(&#39;dbi:driver:...&#39;, $user, $passwd);
  The DBI-&#62;data_sources method should return data_source
  names with the appropriate &#39;dbi:driver:&#39; prefix.
  DBI-&#62;connect will warn if \%attr is true but not a hash ref.
  Added the new fetchrow methods:
    @row_ary  = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_array;
    $ary_ref  = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_arrayref;
    $hash_ref = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_hashref;
  The old fetch and fetchrow methods still work.
  Driver implementors should implement the new names for
  fetchrow_array and fetchrow_arrayref ASAP (use the xs ALIAS:
  directive to define aliases for fetch and fetchrow).
  Fixed occasional problems with t/examp.t test.
  Added automatic errstr reporting to the debug trace output.
  Added the DBI FAQ from Alligator Descartes in module form for
  easy reading via &#34;perldoc DBI::FAQ&#34;. Needs reformatting.

  use by drivers. A macro defines neatsvpv(sv,len) as (DBIS-&#62;neatsvpv(sv,len)).
  Old XS macro SV_YES_NO changes to standard boolSV.
  Since the DBIS structure has change the internal version numbers have also
  changed (DBIXS_VERSION == 8 and DBISTATE_VERSION == 8) so drivers will have
  to be recompiled.</pre>

<pre>  Builds with no changes on NT using perl5.003_99 (with thanks to Jeffrey Urlwin).
  Automatically supports Apache::DBI (with thanks to Edmund Mergl).
    DBI scripts no longer need to be modified to make use of Apache::DBI.
  Added a ping method and an experimental connect_test_perf method.
  Added a fetchhash and fetch_all methods.
  The func method no longer pre-clears err and errstr.
  Added ChopBlanks attribute (currently defaults to off, that may change).
    Support for the attribute needs to be implemented by individual drivers.
  Reworked tests into standard t/*.t form.
  Added more pod text.  Fixed assorted bugs.</pre>

<pre>  Minor release. Tidied up pod text and added some more descriptions
  (especially disconnect). Minor changes to DBI.xs to remove compiler
  warnings.</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Changes_in_DBI_0.78,_28th_Mar_1997"
>Changes in DBI 0.78, 28th Mar 1997</a></h2>

<pre>  Greatly extended the pod documentation in DBI.pm, including the under
  used bind_columns method. Use &#39;perldoc DBI&#39; to read after installing.
  Fixed $h-&#62;err. Fetching an attribute value no longer resets err.
  Added $h-&#62;{InactiveDestroy}, see documentation for details.
  Improved debugging of cached (&#39;quick&#39;) attribute fetches.
  errstr will return err code value if there is no string value.
  Added DBI/W32ODBC to the distribution. This is a pure-perl experimental
  DBI emulation layer for Win32::ODBC. Note that it&#39;s unsupported, your
  mileage will vary, and bug reports without fixes will probably be ignored.</pre>

  Added $h-&#62;err, $h-&#62;errstr and $h-&#62;state default methods in DBI.xs.
  Updated informal DBI API notes in DBI.pm. Updated README slightly.
  DBIXS.h now correctly installed into INST_ARCHAUTODIR.

<pre>  Dispatch now sets dbi_debug to the level of the current handle
  (this makes tracing/debugging individual handles much easier).
  The &#39;&#62;&#62; DISPATCH&#39; log line now only logged at debug &#62;= 3 (was 2).
  The $csr-&#62;NUM_OF_FIELDS attribute can be set if not &#62;0 already.
  You can log to a file using the env var PERL_DBI_DEBUG=/tmp/dbi.log.

<pre>  Minor changes to bring the DBI into line with 5.002 mechanisms,
  specifically the xs/pm VERSION checking mechanism.
  No functionality changes. One no-last-handle bug fix (rare problem).

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Changes_in_DBI_0.65,_23_Oct_1995"
>Changes in DBI 0.65, 23 Oct 1995</a></h2>

<pre>  Added $DBI::state to hold SQL CLI / ODBC SQLSTATE value.
  SQLSTATE &#34;00000&#34; (success) is returned as &#34;&#34; (false), all else is true.
  If a driver does not explicitly initialise it (via $h-&#62;{State} or
  DBIc_STATE(imp_xxh) then $DBI::state will automatically return &#34;&#34; if
  $DBI::err is false otherwise &#34;S1000&#34; (general error).
  As always, this is a new feature and liable to change.

  The is *no longer* a default error handler!
  You can add your own using push(@{$h-&#62;{Handlers}}, sub { ... })
  but be aware that this interface may change (or go away).

  The DBI now automatically clears $DBI::err, errstr and state before
  calling most DBI methods. Previously error conditions would persist.
  Added DBIh_CLEAR_ERROR(imp_xxh) macro.

  DBI now EXPORT_OK&#39;s some utility functions, neat($value),
  neat_list(@values) and dump_results($sth).

  Slightly enhanced t/min.t minimal test script in an effort to help
  narrow down the few stray core dumps that some porters still report.

  Renamed readblob to blob_read (old name still works but warns).
  Added default blob_copy_to_file method.

  Added $sth = $dbh-&#62;tables method. This returns an $sth for a query
  which has these columns: TABLE_CATALOGUE, TABLE_OWNER, TABLE_NAME,
  TABLE_TYPE, REMARKS in that order. The TABLE_CATALOGUE column
  should be ignored for now.</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Changes_in_DBI_0.64,_23_Oct_1995"
>Changes in DBI 0.64, 23 Oct 1995</a></h2>

<pre>  Fixed &#39;disconnect invalidates 1 associated cursor(s)&#39; problem.
  Drivers using DBIc_ACTIVE_on/off() macros should not need any changes
  other than to test for DBIc_ACTIVE_KIDS() instead of DBIc_KIDS().
  Fixed possible core dump in dbih_clearcom during global destruction.</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Changes_in_DBI_0.63,_1_Sep_1995"
>Changes in DBI 0.63, 1 Sep 1995</a></h2>

<pre>  Minor update. Fixed uninitialised memory bug in method
  attribute handling and streamlined processing and debugging.
  Revised usage definitions for bind_* methods and readblob.</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Changes_in_DBI_0.62,_26_Aug_1995"
>Changes in DBI 0.62, 26 Aug 1995</a></h2>

<pre>  Added method redirection method $h-&#62;func(..., $method_name).
  This is now the official way to call private driver methods
  that are not part of the DBI standard.  E.g.:
      @ary = $sth-&#62;func(&#39;ora_types&#39;);
  It can also be used to call existing methods. Has very low cost.

  $sth-&#62;bind_col columns now start from 1 (not 0) to match SQL.
  $sth-&#62;bind_columns now takes a leading attribute parameter (or undef),
  e.g., $sth-&#62;bind_columns($attribs, \$col1 [, \$col2 , ...]);

  Added handy DBD_ATTRIBS_CHECK macro to vet attribs in XS.
  Added handy DBD_ATTRIB_GET_SVP, DBD_ATTRIB_GET_BOOL and
  DBD_ATTRIB_GET_IV macros for handling attributes.

  Fixed STORE for NUM_OF_FIELDS and NUM_OF_PARAMS.
  Added FETCH for NUM_OF_FIELDS and NUM_OF_PARAMS.

  Dispatch no longer bothers to call _untie().
  Faster startup via install_method/_add_dispatch changes.</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Changes_in_DBI_0.61,_22_Aug_1995"
>Changes in DBI 0.61, 22 Aug 1995</a></h2>

<pre>  Added $sth-&#62;bind_col($column, \$var [, \%attribs ]);

  This method enables perl variable to be directly and automatically
  updated when a row is fetched. It requires no driver support
  (if the driver has been written to use DBIS-&#62;get_fbav).
  Currently \%attribs is unused.

  Added $sth-&#62;bind_columns(\$var [, \$var , ...]);

  This method is a short-cut for bind_col which binds all the
  columns of a query in one go (with no attributes). It also
  requires no driver support.

  Added $sth-&#62;bind_param($parameter, $var [, \%attribs ]);

  This method enables attributes to be specified when values are
  bound to placeholders. It also enables binding to occur away
  from the execute method to improve execute efficiency.
  The DBI does not provide a default implementation of this.
  See the DBD::Oracle module for a detailed example.

  The DBI now provides default implementations of both fetch and
  fetchrow.  Each is written in terms of the other. A driver is
  expected to implement at least one of them.

  More macro and assorted structure changes in DBDXS.h. Sorry!
  The old dbihcom definitions have gone. All fields have macros.
  The imp_xxh_t type is now used within the DBI as well as drivers.
  Drivers must set DBIc_NUM_FIELDS(imp_sth) and DBIc_NUM_PARAMS(imp_sth).

  test.pl includes a trivial test of bind_param and bind_columns.</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Changes_in_DBI_0.60,_17_Aug_1995"
>Changes in DBI 0.60, 17 Aug 1995</a></h2>

<pre>  This release has significant code changes but much less
  dramatic than the previous release. The new implementors data
  handling mechanism has matured significantly (don&#39;t be put off
  by all the struct typedefs in DBIXS.h, there&#39;s just to make it
  easier for drivers while keeping things type-safe).

  The DBI now includes two new methods:

  do            $dbh-&#62;do($statement)

  This method prepares, executes and finishes a statement. It is
  designed to be used for executing one-off non-select statements
  where there is no benefit in reusing a prepared statement handle.

  fetch         $array_ref = $sth-&#62;fetch;

  This method is the new &#39;lowest-level&#39; row fetching method. The
  previous @row = $sth-&#62;fetchrow method now defaults to calling
  the fetch method and expanding the returned array reference.

  The DBI now provides fallback attribute FETCH and STORE functions
  which drivers should call if they don&#39;t recognise an attribute.

  THIS RELEASE IS A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR DRIVER DEVELOPERS!
  Study DBIXS.h from the DBI and Oracle.xs etc from DBD::Oracle.
  There will be further changes in the interface but nothing
  as dramatic as these last two releases! (I hope :-)</pre>

<pre>  NOTE: THIS IS AN UNSTABLE RELEASE!

  Major reworking of internal data management!
  Performance improvements and memory leaks fixed.
  Added a new NullP (empty) driver and a -m flag
  to test.pl to help check for memory leaks.
