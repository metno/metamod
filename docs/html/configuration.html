>METAMOD Configuration</a></h1>

<p>Back to <a href="./index.html?view=co" class="podlinkpod"
>Index</a></p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Site_configuration"
>Site configuration</a></h2>

<p>The application configuration directory contains a very important file,
the <b>master_config.txt</b> file.
This file governs how METAMOD will run.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Example_app"
>Example app</a></h2>

<p>The EXAMPLE application that is included in this source tree (app/example) can be used to test the software.
The following steps describes how to do this.
Copy the app/example directory to somewhere local,
preferably renaming it to whatever your METAMOD application is called.
Then you are ready to edit the master configuration file.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Configuration_defaults"
>Configuration defaults</a></h2>

<p>Add some text here...
FIXME</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="The_master_config.txt_file"
>The master_config.txt file</a></h2>

<p>Several variables in this file must be adjusted according to the local computer environment.
The most important are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="APPLICATION_ID"
>APPLICATION_ID</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Each application delivering data to a database (an application with the METAMODUPLOAD,
METAMODHARVEST and/or the METAMODQUEST module) must have a short name (typical an acronym) that uniquely identify the application for the database.
Only upper case letters and numbers are allowed.</p>

<dt><a name="SERVER"
>SERVER</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The server name on which the software should run (something like mycomputer.mydomain.com).</p>

<dt><a name="ADMIN_DOMAIN"
>ADMIN_DOMAIN</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This will typically be the domain found in the SERVER variable (like mydomain.com).</p>

<dt><a name="BASE_PART_OF_EXTERNAL_URL"
>BASE_PART_OF_EXTERNAL_URL</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This is the initial part of URLs that external links to the web applications are to use.
It will typically be <a href="http://mycomputer.mydomain.com" class="podlinkurl"
>http://mycomputer.mydomain.com</a> or <a href="http://mycomputer.mydomain.com:8080" class="podlinkurl"
>http://mycomputer.mydomain.com:8080</a> if you are using an unusual port (note: not to be confused with the Catalyst port - usually 3000).</p>

<dt><a name="LOCAL_URL"
>LOCAL_URL</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Appended to BASE_PART_OF_EXTERNAL_URL,
this represents the top URL for the web applications.
URLs for the individual applications are constructed by appending directory names for each of the applications to this top URL.</p>

<dt><a name="WEBRUN_DIRECTORY"
>WEBRUN_DIRECTORY</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The top directory for the runtime environment.</p>

<dt><a name="OPENDAP_DIRECTORY"
>OPENDAP_DIRECTORY</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The top directory of the data repository.
This directory is assumed to be accessible through an OPeNDAP server which has to be installed as a separate package (not part of METAMOD 2.x).
If no OPeNDAP server is installed,
the METAMOD 2.x software will mostly work,
apart from links to data files from the web applications.</p>

<dt><a name="OPENDAP_URL"
>OPENDAP_URL</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The URL used to access the data files.
If no OPeNDAP server is installed,
use an URL for HTTP download.</p>

<dt><a name="OPERATOR_EMAIL"
>OPERATOR_EMAIL</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>E-mail address for the person responsible for operating the METAMOD 2.x installation.</p>

<dt><a name="SMTP_RELAY"
>SMTP_RELAY</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>If you wish to send email via an external MTA,
enter the qualified hostname here.
Otherwise it is assumed you are running a local (sendmail-compatible) MTA which is configured correctly (firewall will often block this).
See <a href="./deploying.html?view=co" class="podlinkpod"
>Deploying a METAMOD application</a></p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The following variables are used to select the modules that will comprise the application.
whereas they previously indicated the absolute path of the source directory for each module,
they are now only used as booleans (where any non-empty string means true).</p>

<pre>    METAMODBASE_DIRECTORY
    METAMODUPLOAD_DIRECTORY
    METAMODPMH_DIRECTORY
    METAMODHARVEST_DIRECTORY
    METAMODTHREDDS_DIRECTORY</pre>

<p>If any of these variables are missing, the corresponding module will not be part of the application.</p>

<p>A complete inventory of the variables that could be part of the master_config.txt file is found in the <code>app/default/default_config.txt</code> file in the installation directory.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Config_file_format"
>Config file format</a></h2>

<p>The configuration files contain lines as follows:</p>

<pre>    VARNAME = VALUE</pre>

<p>&#39;VARNAME&#39; must start from the first character on the line, and be all uppercase letters [A-Z], underscore or digits. Any number of white space characters may separate &#39;VARNAME&#39; and &#39;=&#39;, and also &#39;=&#39; and &#39;VALUE&#39;. &#39;VALUE&#39; starts with the first non-whitespace character and ends with the last non-whitespace character on the line. Additional lines may be appended to &#39;VALUE&#39; immideately after the initial &#39;VARNAME = ...&#39; line. Such lines must start with a space character. No whitespace are removed from such appended lines.</p>

<p>VALUEs may be empty, which sometimes indicate that some aspect of the software is turned off. An empty value is indicated by having no characters (or only whitespace characters) after the &#39;=&#39; character.</p>

<p>In addition, comment lines, starting with &#39;#&#39;, may be found. Blank lines are ignored.</p>

<p>In the source files, all text strings like:</p>

<p>[==VARNAME==]</p>

<p>will be substituted with the corresponding value at runtime when the variable is accessed. Such text strings may also be found within &#39;VALUE&#39; strings, and they will be substituted as appropriate.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Metadata_configuration_(optional)"
>Metadata configuration (optional)</a></h2>

<p>METAMOD is able to handle a large range of metadata frameworks. For metadata generated through the UPLOAD module (by parsing netCDF files), METAMOD has defined its own XML format, called MM2. This format has a similar structure as Dublin core; it is a flat structure with freely selected metadata keywords. For each keyword one or more values may be found. Other metadata frameworks, like DIF or ISO19115, are also accepted, and such frameworks will typically emerge when harvesting from other metadata providers through OAI-PMH. While such frameworks (DIF, ISO19115) are hierarchical in nature, a flattening of these structures takes place when they are imported to the SQL database and presented through the METAMOD search interface.</p>

<p>The following configuration files regulate which metadata are imported to the SQL database and available for search, how metadata imported by the HARVEST module are translated into the internal flat structure used in the SQL database, and how metadata found in the uploaded netCDF files are translated to MM2 XML files.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="staticdata/searchdata.xml"
>staticdata/searchdata.xml</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This XML file contains metadata vocabularies that are imported into the SQL database, and used in the SEARCH module for setting up the interactive forms for web users searching the database.</p>

<dt><a name="etc/conf_digest_nc.xml"
>etc/conf_digest_nc.xml</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This XML file describes the parsing of netCDF files in the UPLOAD module. Specifically how attributes and variable values in a netCDF file are translated into keyword - value pairs and stored into an MM2 XML file. The <code>conf_digest_nc.xml</code> file will contain rules regarding which metadata are required in the netCDF files. The <code>app/example/etc/conf_digest_nc.xml</code> file represents a well commented example of such a file that can be used as a starting point for a version tailored to specific needs.</p>

<dt><a name="etc/usererrors.conf"
>etc/usererrors.conf</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This file contain html templates that are used in error reports sent to data providers that have uploaded netCDF files using the UPLOAD module. Each template corresponds to an error condition defined in the etc/conf_digest_nc.xml file. An example file in the <code>app/example/etc</code> directory corresponds to the <code>conf_digest_nc.xml</code> in the same directory.</p>

<dt><a name="XSLT"
>XSLT</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Files for translating from foreign metadata formats (... more text is needed)</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Stylesheets_and_other_web_configuration"
>Stylesheets and other web configuration</a></h3>

<p>METAMOD can be configured with custom texts and stylesheets. To modify the styles of the application add the following directories to your application configuration directory.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="custom/templates"
>custom/templates</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This directory contains the Template::Toolkit templates that you want to override in your configuration. It is generally never a good idea to override anything other than the <code>custom.tt</code> file.</p>

<dt><a name="custom/static/css"
>custom/static/css</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This directory contains the CSS files that you want to override in your configuration. It is generally never a good idea to override anything but the <code>custom.css</code> file in this folder.</p>

<dt><a name="custom/static/images"
>custom/static/images</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This folder contains the images that you use in your style configuration.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Overriding_texts"
>Overriding texts</a></h3>

<p>To override texts in the application you use the <code>custom.tt</code> file. <code>custom.tt</code> is a file in <code>Template::Toolkit</code> format.</p>

<p>The way it is used is that it re-defines the default texts found in <code>defaults.tt</code>.</p>

<p>For instance the following would re-define the HTML used for the header of the application.</p>

<pre>  [%

    # get a safe path to the header image that works in both Apache and outside of Apache
    SET header_image_url = c.uri_for(&#39;/static/images/logo.png&#39;);
    app.common.header_html = &#39;&#60;img src=&#34;&#39; _ header_image_url _ &#39;&#34; /&#62;&#39;;

  %]</pre>

<p>In the same way you can re-define any of the variables found in <code>defaults.tt</code></p>

<h3><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Overriding_the_CSS"
>Overriding the CSS</a></h3>

<p>In METAMOD you can override any of the CSS styles in the application using <code>custom.css</code> since this stylesheet will be the last one loaded by the application. It is however wise to <code>only</code> modify properties such as background colors, foreground colors, borders and font size. Modifying the height, width, padding, margins, display type etc. of elements can lead to the application not displaying properly in different browsers. Also modifying these properties can break between different versions of METAMOD.</p>

<p>The style for any element can be modified, but only a few are usually needed. For an example of the common ones see <code>app/example/custom/css/custom.css</code></p>

<h3><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Path_to_images"
>Path to images</a></h3>

<p>One of the most common customisations are adding a logo image to the header and the footer of the page. When adding images to the style it is important to get the path to the image right.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="custom.tt"
>custom.tt</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>To get the path correct in the <code>custom.tt</code> file you can use the following helper function.</p>

<pre> SET image_url = c.uri_for(&#39;/static/images/&#60;your image name here&#62;&#39;);</pre>

<p>This makes a variable <code>image_url</code> that contains the correct URL to the image file.</p>

<dt><a name="custom.css"
>custom.css</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>To get the path correct in the <code>custom.css</code> file you can use the following path.</p>

<pre>  url(&#34;../images/aboutheader.gif&#34;);</pre>

<p>as in</p>

<pre>  background-image: url(&#34;../images/aboutheader.gif&#34;);</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
