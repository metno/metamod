=head1 METAMOD documentation

METAMOD 2.x is a portal solution providing Discovery, Access and Retrieve
functionality for scientific datasets along with tools for metadata handling
etc. It allows for automatical and manual DAR Metadata creation. The Metadata
can be converted to different formats and exposed using different
search-interfaces, i.e. L<ISO 23950|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z39.50>
and L<OAI-PMH|http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/>.

METAMOD 2.x has been designed to be easily integratable with
L<OPeNDAP|http://opendap.org/> or ftp data-servers, i.e.
L<THREDDS|http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/> and allows data-upload
through FTP and HTTP interfaces.
