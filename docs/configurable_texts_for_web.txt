Configurable texts in web pages and E-mail to users
===================================================

The texts in web pages that vary between METAMOD instances are all configured through master_config.txt.
This overview shows which config variables are used for this purpose, which source files in METAMOD 2.6
are relevant and a small explanation on how the texts are used. Configurable texts found in E-mail sent
to users are also included.
