=head2 Configuration

Keeping track of all necessary config variables in master_config.txt has
often been the most time-consuming part of setting up a new installation.
The C<lsconf> tool has been developed to assist with this.
Here are some examples (using virtualenv):

Checking if your configuration is valid:

    $ lsconf --check
    # Testing config in /home/anton/metamod/mysite
    ok 1 - config directory found
    ok 2 - WEBRUN_DIRECTORY is writable: /home/anton/metamod/webrun
    [...]
    ok 37 - OPERATOR_EMAIL is a valid email address
    1..37

How to get nice color output when using a pager:

    $ lsconf --color | less -R
