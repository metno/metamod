1.x     2002-2007
    During 2001/2002, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (METNO) implemented
    a web based tool (MetaMod) for searching data archived under the NoSerC
    project (http://noserc.met.no/). This tool was adapted for the DAMOCLES
    project in 2006/2007. The web interface and the overall functionality of the
    tool were very much improved during the DAMOCLES development, and just a
    small part of the original code base has remained unchanged.
