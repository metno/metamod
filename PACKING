The authorative list of Perl dependency modules is in ./cpanfile.

Running "carton install" will read the requirements from cpanfile and update the
dependency list in cpanfile.snapshot.

  $ carton install
  $ svn ci cpanfile.snapshot

NOTE: The act of building a package MUST not generate any changes in SVN, since we
plan on automating the package building process into the CI testing framework
(where the changes would never be committed).

-----------

Updating the Carton bundle in SVN:

  $ #carton bundle --no-fatpack # deprecated
  $ make bundle
  $ svn add --force vendor/cache

Then install via

  $ #carton install --cached --deployment # deprecated
  $ make deployment
  $ make debian_package
  $ dupload --to precise-devel # or whatever
